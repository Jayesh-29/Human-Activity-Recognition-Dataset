# Human-Activity-Recognition-Dataset
The Human Activity Recognition Dataset is built based on experiments carried over 30 participants within an age bracket of 19-48 years where the performed daily activities (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, laying) while wearing a waist-mounted smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II). By using the embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a rate of 50Hz were captured. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has then been randomly partitioned into two parts; data from 70% of the people was selected for generating the training data and the remaining 30% was used for the test data. Data description: The dataset contains 561 predictors (columns) with time and frequency domain variables and their corresponding activity labels. The acquired data was preprocessed for noise. The sensor acceleration signal consisted of gravitational and body motion components which were separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter.
